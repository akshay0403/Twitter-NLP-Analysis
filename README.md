# Twitter-NLP-Analysis
# Overview
This repository contains code for an NLP project focused on analyzing tweets using the spaCy library. It demonstrates the use of core NLP techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and dependency parsing to extract linguistic insights from social media content. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for modular experimentation and clarity.

# Abstract
This project explores Natural Language Processing techniques on Twitter data using spaCy. It provides a practical pipeline for text preprocessing, linguistic feature extraction, and entity recognition, with a focus on applying syntactic and semantic analysis to short-form, user-generated content.

# Introduction
The aim is to build a foundational NLP pipeline using spaCy to process and analyze tweet text data. Given the informal and often noisy nature of Twitter content, this project focuses on core preprocessing steps and syntactic parsing to transform raw tweets into structured information, which can serve as a basis for further tasks like sentiment analysis, tweet classification, or event detection.

# Problem Statement
Develop an NLP pipeline that effectively analyzes tweet text, extracting key linguistic components like named entities, parts of speech, and syntactic dependencies to support downstream NLP tasks.

# Motivation
 - **Social Media Mining:** Tweets are rich in real-time, user-generated content, making them valuable for sentiment analysis, trend detection, and public opinion mining.

- **spaCy Integration:** Utilize spaCy's efficient NLP pipeline to handle real-world noisy text data.

- **Extendability:** The project serves as a modular base that can be extended to build more advanced NLP systems like topic modeling, summarization, or text classification.

# Key Points
**Text Preprocessing**
- **Cleansing:** Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering

- **Tokenization and Lemmatization:** Using spaCyâ€™s tokenizer and lemmatizer for normalization

**Linguistic Feature Extraction**

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identifies the grammatical role of each token

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extracts people, organizations, places, and other entities

- **Dependency Parsing:** Analyzes syntactic relationships between words in each tweet

# Future Enhancements
- Add sentiment analysis module

- Integrate Twitter API or snscrape for real-time data

- Create a web interface for live tweet annotation and insights
